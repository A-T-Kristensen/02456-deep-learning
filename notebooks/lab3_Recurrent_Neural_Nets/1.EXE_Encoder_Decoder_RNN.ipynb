    "## Encoder-Decoder\n",
    "In this exercise we'll implement a Encoder-Decoder RNN based for a simple sequence to sequence translation task.\n",
    "We will use a special kind of unit, called the GRU unit.\n",
    "The GRU unit stores a hidden value per neuron that helps it '*remember*' long-term dependencies.\n",
    "Another popular choice of unit type is LSTM, which store two values, but these are approximately twice as slow as GRU.\n",
    "GRUs (and LSTMs) can be difficult to understand at first.\n",
    "For a very good not-to-mathematical introduction see \n",
    "[Chris Olahs blog](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) or\n",
    "[Andrej Karpathys blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)\n",
    "(All their posts are nice and cover various topics within machine-learning).\n",
    "This type of models have shown impressive performance in Neural Machine Translation and Image Caption generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder-decoder structure one RNN (blue) encodes the input into a hidden representation, and a second RNN (red) uses this representation to predict the target values.\n",
    "An essential step is deciding how the encoder and decoder should communicate.\n",
    "In the simplest approach you use the last hidden state of the encoder to initialize the decoder.\n",
    "This is what we will do in this notebook, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/enc-dec.png', width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Teacher forcing\n",
    "We will also use what is called *teacher forcing*.\n",
    "This is shown as the gray lines in the figure.\n",
    "This means that the RNN will implement a sequence of conditional distributions so the $t$th output of the decoder gives $p(y_t|y_1,\\dots,y_{t-1} ,x)$. This formulation will make the task easier and faster for the network to learn because it during training always have access to the correct preceding outputs.\n",
    "A test time where we we don't know the output sequence we have to predict one step at a time. \n",
    "There is no guarantee that we will find the mostly likely decoded *sequence*. A technique called [beam search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01806.pdf) is used in machine translation and related tasks to look for list of candidate decoded sequences.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternatives\n",
    "There are other ways to let the encoder and decoder communicate with each other.\n",
    "For instance you can give the last state of the Encoder as input to the Decoder at each decode time step, not just the previously predicted word.\n",
    "Another approache is called **attention**, which lets the Decoder attend to different parts of the encoded input at different timesteps in the decoding process. \n",
    "Attention is shown in the next notebook. \n",

    "### The Data\n",
