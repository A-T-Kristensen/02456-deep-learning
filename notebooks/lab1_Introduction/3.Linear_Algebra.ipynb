    "In the former notebook we developed a simple FFN in pure python. Although it worked, it required a lot of code, and as you will see it was extremely slow. Luckily for us, almost all the operations needed for propagating the inputs through the neural network and updating the weights afterwards can be calculated efficiently using linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to use the scientific computing library Numpy to define the exact same network as we did before. We do this to show how much more compact the network can be formulated if we use concepts from linear algebra. \n",
    "When we afterwards use specialized deep learning frameworks do define the networks, it is important to remember that these are based on linear algebra as well, and are doing almost the same as we do here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference is that they include advanced techniques for redundant operations and use the available hardware optimally."
