    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is the most fundamental algorithm on which all other concepts within deep learning relies. At first backpropagation may seem very complicated. However in its' essence, all it is, is a generalization of  can be the [chain-rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a neural network (parameterized by weights $W$) predicts a target given an input x i.e. $\\hat{y} = p(y|x,W)$. Training a neural network then corresponds to changing the weights $W$ such that the error $E$ between the predicted targets $\\hat{y}$ and the true targets $y$ is minimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks are usually trained using [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent). Here we update $W_{ij}$ by going in the negative direction of $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{ji}}$ with $\\alpha$ determining the step size.\n",
    "$$W_{ij} = W_{ij} - \\alpha\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{ji}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is simply an effective way to calculate the exact gradient of $E$ w.r.t to all the weights in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice backpropagation is done with linear algebra. However, showcasing the math behind backpropagation with abstract linear algebra hides the inherent simplicity of the algorithm. Because of this, we will in this notebook only deal with networks which has a single unit in each layer. If you want to dig deeper into how backpropagation handles matrixes of various sizes there are numerous sources online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Futhermore we will use [Mean Squared error (MSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) as our cost function and sigmoid functions as our [activation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function)."

    "# Forward pass / propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do backpropagation we first need to propagate the input through the network from its' input units to its' output units. This is called a forward pass or forward propagation. We need to do this both in order to calculate the error $E$ between our predictions $\\hat{y}$ and the actual targets $y$ and to have access the activations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we break forward propagation into its' individual steps it is actually very simple. In each layer we take the input, multiply it by the weights and uses the result of this multiplication as the input to an acitvation function (Here the sigmoid function shown in the lower left corner of the animation). \n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the functions actually becomes longer and longer, as we get deeper into the network. This is because the later layers are strictly dependent on the former layers, this means that in layer $L_i$ we would in theory need to recalculate all operations from $L_0$ to $L_{i - 1}$. In modern networks this would require emense computational power, which is why we store the result of each operation in memory. This is important to remember, because it is the direct reason neural network has such a big memory requirement compared to other algorithms. "
