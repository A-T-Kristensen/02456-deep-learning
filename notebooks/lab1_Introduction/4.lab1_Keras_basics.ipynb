    "Pure TF is very verbose, and it is therefore a good idea to use a high-level API of some sort.\n",
    "This simplifies and speeds-up development, reduces the risk of bugs, and generally reduces headache.\n",
    "Another neat benefit is that a lot of best practices (initialization, scoping, etc.) are hard-coded into the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Keras](https://keras.io/)**\n",
    "is a high-level API that can use TensorFlow or Theano as backend.\n",
    "In early 2017 [TensorFlow chose Keras](http://www.fast.ai/2017/01/03/keras/) as the first high-level API to include into the tensorflow core (as opposed to contrib).\n",
    "Keras has official Google support and has a large community and pre-existing examples.\n",
    "Making it a good choice for high-level API to learn at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There several other high-level APIs: \n",
    "* [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/),\n",
    "* [tf.learn](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/tflearn) (yes, the names are confusing :( ),\n",
    "* [tf.slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim), and\n",
    "* [tf.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers).\n",
    "These are generally compatible with each other, and offer overlaping functionality.\n",
    "This can be confusing.\n",
    "In order to simplify things we have chosen to focus on just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a quick introduction to Keras.\n",
    "As with the TF introduction this is very quick, so have a look at the **external resources** in order to get more depth:\n",
    "* [Keras code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/keras) in the TF github repo. Looking at the code is often the best way to understand what is going on. Keras also provides some good [example code](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples), that demonstrates how to do many things.\n",
