# DTU course 02456 Deep learning v2.0 alpha

## Installation
All exercises are written in Python programming language and formatted into Jupyter Notebooks. In order to run the exercises you must satisfy the below requirements:

**1. Python 3.5**

- We recommend installing via **Anaconda** from [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),
as it provides many useful third party libraries.

- We use `Python 3.5` since it is the only version TensorFlow supports on Windows
(at least as of May 2017).

**2. TensorFlow 1.1**

- Follow the installation instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/.

- If you have a GPU install the GPU version. This greatly decreases training time.

- The exercises are tested with `TensorFLow 1.1`, but other versions might also work


## Running the Exercises
The exercises are created as Jupyter Notebooks.

If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter we suggest that you familiarize yourself beginning with the exercises: [quick introduction](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/basics-jupyter-notebook-and-python), [thorough introduction](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#gs.a6M6p0Q). But very briefly Jupyter Notebooks are interactive Python environments that allow us to combine documentation (images, text, etc.) with code.

### Acessing the exercises:
1. Download the repository from Github
1. In a terminal/command prompt type: `jupyter notebook`
    * This should start your default browser and you should be up and running.
    * **Safari** is known to cause issues, so we recommend that you use the newest version of Chrome.

**TIP**: In the menue bar in the top you can go to `Help >> Keyboard Shortcuts` and see a list of shortcuts.
Here is a convenient shortlist

| Shortcut        	| Action                                                                                  	|
|-----------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `CTRL + Enter`  	| Execute current cell                                                                    	|
| `Shift + Enger` 	| Execute current cell, and select to next                                                	|
| `Esc`           	| Leave **edit mode** and enter **command mode**                                          	|
| `a`             	| while in **command** mode: Create new cell above current                                    	|
| `b`             	| while in **command** mode: Create new cell below current                                    	|
| `dd`            	| while in **command** mode: Delete current cell                                              	|
| `ii`            	| while in **command** mode: Interrupt kernel (same as `CTRL + c` when using Python normally) 	|
| `Shift + Tab`   	| while in **edit** mode: Inspect element (useful for **debugging!**)                        	|
| `l`   	 	 	| while in **edit** mode: Display line numblers (useful for **debugging!**)         

### Using Docker:
In order to make the material as accessible as possible we have also included Dockerfiles. So you can get the code up and running quickly on any computer. Now if you are not familiar with Docker we will give you a short introduction here. However, there is great documentation on their website, and amazing tutorials around the web. So we will barely touch the surface of what you can do with Docker.

#### Setup
First of all, you will need to have Docker installed on your computer. The complexity of this task varies tremendously on the operation system of your computer. But go to [Docker’s homepage](https://www.docker.com/) and follow their instructions.

With Docker installed on your system all you have to do is enter the main folder of this repository. Here you will find two Dockerfiles: “Dockerfile.cpu” and “Dockerfile.gpu”. You then rename “Dockerfile.cpu” to “Dockerfile” since this is the filename which Docker looks for.

From here you have to build a docker image using the command:
`docker build –t deeplearning .`

You can just copy the line above, but in order to shortly explain what is going on, you simple create a virtual image specified by the Docker file. This image you assign the tag deeplearning using the “-t” parameter. Finally you tell Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory. This is shown graphically below:

![Building image]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning/blob/master/files/build_docker.png')

When the image is built you want to run it. This is done with the command:
`docker run –it –p 8888:8888 –v $(pwd)/notebooks:/notebooks deeplearning`

A lot is going on in the command above. First we tell Docker to run an image. We specify it should be done in an interactive manner (through the “-it” parameter) and to map the local port 8888 to the port 8888 in the image. This allows us to access Jupyter from our host machine. We then tell Docker to synchronize the notebooks folder with a corresponding folder inside the image. Finally we tell Docker to use the `deeplearning` image we just created. This is shown visually below:

![Running image]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning/blob/master/files/run_docker.png')

#### Using GPU
If you have a computer with a GPU which can run CUDA you will want to use your GPU as much as possible. This makes things a bit more complicated, but you will surely be up for the task. First of all, you have to [check whether there is a driver for your GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). Then you will want to follow the instructions on installing CUDA and CUDNN on your operating system. With this in place you need to install  [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)  in order to be able to access the GPU from the virtual machine.

There can be quite a few complications along the way to get to this far. But once here it is very simple. All you have to do is to use the Dockerfile.gpu from our repository and follow the general instructions above replacing the normal “docker” command with “nvidia-docker”.

So building a Docker image becomes:
`nvidia-docker build –t deeplearning .`

and running the image becomes:
`nvidia-docker run –it –p 8888:8888 –v $(pwd)/notebooks:/notebooks deeplearning`
