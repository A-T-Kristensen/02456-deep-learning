# DTU course 02456 Deep learning v2.0 alpha

This repository contains the exercises and supplementary material for course [02456 deep learning](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456).

## Installation
All exercises are written in Python programming language and formatted into Jupyter Notebooks. In order to run the exercises you must satisfy the below requirements:

**1. Python 3.5**

- We recommend installing via **Anaconda** from [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),
as it provides many useful third party libraries. 

- We use `Python 3.5` since it is the only version TensorFlow supports on Windows 
(at least as of May 2017).

**2. Tensorflow 1.1**

- Follow the installation instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/.

- If you have a GPU install the GPU version. This greatly decreases training time.

- The exercises are tested with `TensorFLow 1.1`, but other versions might also work


## Running the notebooks
1. Download the repository from Github
1. In a terminal/command prompt type: `jupyter notebook` 
    * This should start your default browser and you should be up and running. 
    * **Safari** is known to cause issues, so we recommend that you use the newest version of Chrome.
